    "Answer : Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves dividing an image into its constituent parts or objects. It's a crucial step in image analysis, as it allows for the identification and separation of objects within an image.

    "Answer : Image classification involves assigning a label to an entire image, whereas object detection involves locating and classifying specific objects within an image. Image segmentation takes it a step further by dividing the image into its constituent parts, assigning a label to each pixel or region. In other words, image classification answers \"what is in the image?\", object detection answers \"where is the object in the image?\", and image segmentation answers \"what is the precise boundary of the object in the image?\"."

    "Answer : Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) is a state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation model. It's different from traditional object detection models because it not only detects objects but also generates a mask for each object, which is a pixel-level segmentation of the object.
