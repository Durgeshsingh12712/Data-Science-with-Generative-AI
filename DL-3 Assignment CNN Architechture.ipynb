    "Answer : Backpropagation Process in CNNs:\n",
    "1. Gradient of Loss w.r.t Output:\n",
    "Start by computing the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the network. This tells how much the output of the network changes with respect to a small change in the output layer’s activation.\n",
    "2. Gradients in Fully Connected Layers:\n",
    "In the fully connected layers (if present), the backpropagation computes how the weights in these layers affect the final output. This is done by calculating the gradients of the loss with respect to these weights and using the chain rule to propagate the error back through these layers.\n",
    "3. Gradients in Convolutional Layers:\n",
    "The convolutional layers are a bit more complex, as they use filters (kernels). The gradients for these filters are computed by considering how the filters (weights) affected the activations in the previous layers.\n",
    "For each convolutional filter, you compute how much the filter contributed to the error in the final loss.\n",
    "The gradients of the filters are computed by sliding the filter over the feature maps in the backpropagation process, essentially applying the chain rule again but for the convolutions.\n",
    "4. Gradients in Pooling Layers:\n",
    "Pooling layers (like max pooling or average pooling) don’t have weights, but they affect the forward pass by reducing the spatial dimensions of the data.\n",
    "During backpropagation, the gradient of the loss is propagated back through the pooling layer, and the relevant gradients are \"passed\" to the correct locations in the feature map (i.e., the location that contributed to the pooling operation).\n",
    "5. Update Weights (Gradient Descent)\n",
    "After calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to all weights, the weights are updated using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or more advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, etc.).\n",
    "The weights are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss function. The size of the update is determined by the learning rate.\n",
    "6. Repeat\n",
    "This process is repeated for several iterations (epochs), with each epoch involving a forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, and weight updates. The weights get progressively tuned to minimize the loss over time."
