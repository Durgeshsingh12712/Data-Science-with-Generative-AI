    "Answer : Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a machine translation approach that uses statistical models to generate translations. It's based on the idea that a translation can be generated by analyzing large amounts of bilingual text data and using probability to determine the most likely translation. SMT systems typically consist of three components: a language model, a translation model, and a decoder."
